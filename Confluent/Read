Design-
two-factor auth service
tinurl-uniqueId generation focus
was this something related to dealing with files content at byte level? or more like designing an in-memory file system
 with a trie data structure?

I had 3 rounds:


1st round - Problem similar to LRU cache
2nd round was DSA (a backtracking question was given)
3rd round - A LLD kind question where had to design a data structure to process some queries


Expectation was to give running code in all 3 rounds

Design round 1(API design) - Spotify like system. Design APIs to retrieve X podcast channels at a time,
X audio clips per podcast channel, Database design and high level component design [pagination, skip tokens, limit/offset, api versioning, back of the napkin calculation for number of users to number of podcast channels, podcast channel to number of audio clips per channel, corner cases[users subscribed to a lot of channels, channels with a lot of videos, etc.,]]

https://leetcode.com/discuss/interview-question/3878652/Design-key-value-store-or-Confluent-or-SSE-2
Design a high throughput, low latency, fault-tolerant
persistent
 key-value store.
Runs as a network service supporting many clients in a data center.
Uses the standard key-value store operations: get, put, delete.
Keys and values are simple byte[].
Assume high write throughput.
This doesn't necessarily mean requests are skewed significantly towards writes,
just that we want as much write throughput as possible on a single node.
